GIT

1. Distributed version-control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinationg work on those files among multiple people.

*Distributed = (kinda) Every user's system has it's own copy (clone) of file/ set of files.

2. Version can be reversed using GIT easily. History of changes or metadata is also kept.

3. Management of changes that occur in collaborative programming.

4. Repo/Repository - Project stored on GIT. Can be public or private.

5. Why use GIT?
	
	Undo mistakes by creating checkpoints and reverting versions and changes easily.
	Distributed development and collaborative programming. Merge differently created features and parts easily.
	Different useful features like timeline to analyse progress of the project.
	Things don't get mixed up and branching of master project for easiness and efficiency.
	Community support. :) (40M+ users)

6. Creating a GIT repo -

	Change directory to the folder.
	cmd: git init	
	cmd: git status
	cmd: git add <filename> (for adding to staging area)
	*Staging area and commit
	cmd: git commit -m "<commit_msg>" (commit changes to the project and create a checkpoint with a commit message using the argument -m)
	cmd: git log (to check the commits attempted and get bash code for reverting, in case required)
	*Commiting without any additional files will result in "nothing to commit"
	cmd: git rm --cached <file_name> (unstage any files to become untracked)
	cmd: git branch <branch-name> (Create a sub-branch on current branch)
	cmd: git checkout <branch-name> (Switching to a branch)
	cmd: git commit -am (Adding and commiting altogether)
